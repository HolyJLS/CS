    "Face <font color='blue'>*E*</font> is the one that requires the computer to ask the most questions.\n",
    "Here is why:\n",
    ">Using these questions, distinguishing between faces E and F requires 77 questions (the final question about glasses, as well as the 66 questions leading up to that point).\n",
    "\n",
    ">Here is the series of questions and answers that lead us to identifying face E:\n",
    ">1.Beard? (No)\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. Brown hair? (No)\n",
    ">3. Smiling? (Yes)\n",
    ">4. Blue hair? (No)\n",
    ">5. Long hair? (No)\n",
    ">6. Black hair? (Yes)\n",
    ">7. Glasses? (Yes)\n",
    "\n",
    ">By contrast:\n",
    ">identifying face C requires asking 44 questions,\n",
    ">identifying face G requires asking 66 questions, and\n",
    ">identifying face H requires asking 33 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer gets a few pieces of information from a camera that can detect glasses, long hair, and open mouths. The computer uses this information to answer the decision tree’s questions, allowing it to distinguish between all the faces.\n",

    "The first question, which is at the very top of the decision tree, is an especially important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you want to make a decision tree that can distinguish the four faces above. If you want the root of the decision tree to split the faces into two groups of two, which question should you ask first?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Is their mouth open?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is why:\n",
    ">Explanation\n",
    ">One of the given questions splits the four faces into two groups of two:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Is their mouth open?\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">The other two questions split the faces into groups of 3 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    ">3 characters have long hair.\n",
    "\n",
    ">3 characters do not have pink glasses.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is a single question that you could ask of both remaining groups to narrow down to a single face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: None of these will work\n",
    "\n",
    ">Explanation\n",
    ">None of these single questions will work for both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the group on the right, the one containing two closed-mouthed frowning faces, \"pink glasses?\" is the only one of the >questions listed that distinguishes between the two faces.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the group on the left, only the question \"long hair?\" will work to distinguish the faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last question, none of the choices you were given were able to further split up both of the groups of two faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can make a decision tree that distinguishes all four faces by asking a different follow-up question based on the answer to the first question.\n",

    "The last tree split the faces into even groups with each question. Decision trees like this are called balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose our questions carefully, we can build an even bigger balanced tree that can distinguish 88 faces:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If your computer is using this decision tree, how many questions, on average, will it need to ask in order to distinguish a random face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 3\n",
    "\n",
    ">Explanation: It will always take exactly three questions for your computer program to pinpoint which of the eight faces it is >looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To identify the rightmost face, the three questions will be these:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Glasses? (No.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Long hair? (No.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Black hair? (No.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">These three questions pinpoint the rightmost face among the eight candidates.\n",
    ">To identify the face with blue hair, the three questions will be these:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Glasses? (Yes.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Brown hair? (No.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Long hair? (Yes.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">These three questions pinpoint the face with blue hair among the eight candidates.\n",
    ">Because every face can be identified with exactly three questions, the average number of questions must also be three.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of a decision tree can have a big impact on the number of questions you have to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree we just saw was balanced, and could distinguish every face using 33 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tree we saw in this quiz distinguished the same 88 faces, but had a wider range in the number of questions required:\n",
    "\n",

    "How many of the faces take more than 3 questions to identify using this decision tree?\n",

    "\n",
    ">The questions \"Beard?\" \"Brown hair?\" and \"Smiling?\" can identify only 33 faces with certainty. The other 55 faces require more >than 33 questions to identify with this decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    ">That means that if we imagine the two decision trees \"racing\" to identify a random face, the tree shown here will lose to the >previous tree most of the time.\n",

    "This decision tree has instructions for distinguishing six faces. Which face will you land on if you use this to identify the following, different face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: F\n",
    "\n",
    ">Explanation: Because the new face doesn't have brown hair, we will follow the \"no\" path for the first question. Likewise, because the face does not have black hair, we will follow the \"no\" path for the second question. This leads to the face labeled F.\n",

    "The decision tree didn't do a good job recognizing this face. They're about as different as can be, but the computer decided they're similar!\n",
    "\n",
    "Asked in the context of the original 66 faces, the decision tree works just fine. But, with just a slight change in Person A's appearance, the tree is unable to distinguish him from Person F, blue hair and all.\n",

    "This is a simple example, but if you pay attention to the news, you'll see real-world examples of the same kind of failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "It can be funny when computers make mistakes because they were designed with limited information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/jWKiq5ptUFZ7OWmrXHRkDX-Course-Computer-Science-Fundamentals-Doodle-Style-1836-25546-h0HO8h.png?width=550\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "These mistakes happen because decision trees don’t “see” faces or dogs. They only consider the features that we tell them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the computer is focusing on the relative placement of dark circles and the fact that they’re inside of a tan colored circle. If the decision tree is calibrated for identifying breeds of dogs, but doesn’t know about muffins, hijinks may ensue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other cases are more worrying — many computer programs that do real-life facial recognition don't work well for people with darker skin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can happen when the facial recognition program is designed using pictures that skew too heavily toward lighter skin tones. The program ends up with less information about darker features, which lead it to make crude classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/jWKiq5ptUFZ7OWmrXHRkDX-Course-Computer-Science-Fundamentals-Doodle-Style-1829-11-NFp1ce.png?width=550\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve picked up some key ideas behind decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computers are very fast at answering simple questions\n",
    "* Decision trees break down complex decisions into simple questions\n",
    "* The order of questions can change the number of questions you have to ask\n",
    "* Using incomplete information in designing a decision tree can lead to unintended outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "However, decision trees aren't the right tool for every problem. For example, how would you use a decision tree to sort a deck of cards?\n",
    "\n",
